						The Civilian Defense Front (CDF) is a prominent faction in the "After the Flash" universe, known for its unique and somewhat controversial approach to survival and community building. The CDF's origins can be traced back to a group of survivors who, in the wake of the apocalyptic event, refused to adopt the aggressive and militaristic ideologies of many other factions. Instead, they chose a path rooted in civilian protection, humanitarianism, and diplomacy.<br>
						<br>
						The CDF's primary goal is to establish safe havens for ordinary people in the dangerous post-apocalyptic world. They believe in the power of community, cooperation, and diplomacy over aggression, seeking to build bridges with other factions rather than engage in conflicts. While they maintain a well-armed defensive force to protect their settlements, the CDF emphasizes negotiation, trade, and peaceful coexistence whenever possible.<br>
						    <br>
						The faction's settlements are often known for their hospitality, offering refuge to travelers and trade opportunities to nearby groups. The CDF values knowledge and education, and they have libraries and schools within their communities, striving to preserve pre-apocalyptic knowledge and culture. Despite their peaceful ideals, the CDF is not without its challenges, as their refusal to engage in aggressive expansion has led to tension with more power-hungry factions. Nonetheless, their unique approach and commitment to fostering cooperation make them a distinctive and fascinating faction in the "After the Flash" lore.<br>
